                <div>
                    <p>Mountain climbing, commonly known as mountaineering, a sport that involves reaching or making
                        an
                        effort to reach high points in mountainous terrain, primarily for personal enjoyment. Although
                        the
                        phrase is frequently used informally to refer to hiking up low mountains with only moderate
                        difficulties, it is actually better reserved for climbing in places where the terrain and
                        weather
                        conditions present enough risks that a certain amount of prior experience will be deemed
                        necessary
                        for safety. Mountaineering is a risky sport to engage in if you are unprepared.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    Mountaineering is distinct from other outdoor activities in that the participant's playing area and
                    the
                    majority of the challenges come entirely from nature. The sensations provided by pushing one's
                    fortitude, resourcefulness, cunning, strength, ability, and stamina to the limit in a situation with
                    inherent risk are embodied in mountain climbing. Unlike other sports, mountaineering is primarily a
                    team
                    sport, with each participant contributing to and benefiting from the success of the team at every
                    level.
                    Most climbers find that the joys of mountaineering come not just from the "conquest" of a peak, but
                    also
                    from the emotional and physical fulfillments gained from putting out great personal effort,
                    mastering
                    new skills, and coming into contact with the magnificence of nature.

                    Early attempts to climb mountains were motivated by reasons other than athletic aspirations, such as
                    the need to erect altars, the desire to determine whether ghosts still haunted once-forbidden
                    heights,
                    the desire to gain perspective on one's own or nearby countryside, or the desire to make
                    meteorological
                    or geological observations. Prior to the modern age, there were not many attempts to climb mountains
                    for
                    the purpose of achievement. During the 18th century a growing number of natural philosophers—the
                    scientists of their day—began making field trips into the Alps of Europe to make scientific
                    observations. These researchers had a specific interest in the region surrounding Chamonix, France,
                    due
                    to the massive glaciers on the Mont Blanc chain.

                <p>When young Genevese scientist Horace-Bénédict de Saussure first visited Chamonix in 1760, he saw Mont
                    Blanc, which at 15,771 feet [4,807 meters] is the tallest peak in Europe, and made the decision that
                    he would either climb to the top of it or be in charge of its ascent. This is when mountaineering as
                    we know it today was born. He offered a prize for the first ascent of Mont Blanc, but it took a
                    Chamonix doctor named Michel-Gabriel Paccard and his porter named Jacques Balmat more than 25 years
                    to claim their share of the prize money. De Saussure himself reached the top of Mont Blanc a year
                    later.</p>
                <p>In the 1950s came a series of successful ascents of mountains in the Himalayas: a first climb by the
                    French of Annapurna I (26,545 feet [8,091 metres]) in June 1950, Nanga Parbat (26,660 feet [8,126
                    metres]) by the Germans and Austrians in 1953, Kanchenjunga (28,169 feet [8,586 metres]) by the
                    British in May 1955, and Lhotse I (27,940 feet [8,516 metres]) by the Swiss in 1956. In addition, K2
                    in the Karakoram Range, at 28,251 feet (8,611 metres) the world’s second highest mountain, was first
                    scaled by two Italian climbers in July 1954. Beyond all those, however, the success of the British
                    on Mount Everest (29,035 feet [8,850 metres]; see Researcher’s Note: Height of Mount Everest)—when a
                    New Zealand beekeeper, Edmund (later Sir Edmund) Hillary, and the Tibetan guide Tenzing Norgay stood
                    on the top of the world on May 29, 1953—was a culminating moment. That expedition, which was led by
                    Colonel John Hunt, was the eighth team in 30 years to attempt Everest, and there had also been three
                    reconnaissance expeditions.</p>
                <img style="align-content: center;" width="500rem" src="images/history-2.png" alt="">
                <p>Beginning in the 1960s, mountaineering underwent several transformations. Once peaks were climbed,
                    the emphasis moved to a search for increasingly difficult routes up the mountain face to the summit,
                    as in the golden age of the Alpine ascents. A notable example was the 1963 ascent of the West Face
                    of Everest by two members of the first American team to climb the mountain. Moreover, vertical or
                    other so-called impossible rock faces were being scaled through the use of newly developed
                    artificial aids and advanced climbing techniques. Smooth vertical faces of granite were overcome in
                    climbs lasting days or even weeks at a time—for example, the 27-day conquest by American climbers in
                    1970 of the sheer 3,600-foot (1,100-metre) southeast face of the granite monolith El Capitan in
                    Yosemite National Park in the North American Sierra Nevada range. Other notable developments
                    included an increase in the “Alpine” style of climbing the highest peaks, where mountaineers carried
                    a minimal amount of equipment and supplies and did not rely on porters and other outside support,
                    and a rise in the number of people climbing at high elevations without the use of supplemental
                    oxygen.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Rock Climbing</h2>
                    <p>Its hard to overstate the importance of good technique. When you focus on technique, moves start
                        to click into place and you find yourself floating up routes that used to be too difficult. This
                        section covers some key concepts:

                        Ways to use your feet
                        Ways to maintain balance
                        Ways to be more efficient</p>
                    <p>Feet are the foundation of climbing. Lots of beginners try to pull themselves up the wall and
                        quickly tire out. Think about climbing a ladder—you don’t pull yourself up, you step up, and use
                        your arms and hands for balance. It’s the same in climbing.

                        Basic techniques for using your feet are <b>edging</b> and <b>smearing</b>:

                        Edging is exactly what it sounds like: You step on a hold with the rubber on the edge of your
                        shoe. You can use the inside edge, where your big toe offers stability on smaller holds, or you
                        can use the outside edge. Your choice depends on the direction you need to move in order to get
                        on or off the hold.
                        Smearing happens when you don’t have an actual foothold, so you rely on your shoe’s rubber for
                        friction against the rock. Smearing is useful in slab climbing, when you’re on low-angle rock
                        without many defined footholds.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <img src="rockclimb.jpg" width="500rem" alt="">
                    <p>When climbing, keep the following footwork techniques in mind:

                        Keep your feet as close to your body as possible. Look for footholds in advantageous spots so
                        you can keep your balance.

                        Rather than handholds, pay greater attention to foot placements.

                        Keep your foot motionless after you've planted it. As you make your subsequent move, you'll
                        stand a better chance of maintaining the hold.

                        Maintain a low heel so you can make good touch with the wall. Less rubber is on the rock when
                        you have a high heel, which reduces friction and increases the likelihood that you will lever
                        your foot off the wall when you make your next move.</p>

                <div>
                    <img src="stemming.jpg" width="500rem" alt="">
                    <p>Your hands are pressed against the opposing walls, as are your legs. According to the
                        "three-point suspension" rule, a climber should have "two feet and one hand" or "one hand and
                        two feet" at the rock's surface at all times.

                        As you lift your feet and shift your weight to either hand while moving upward, your hands
                        should maintain your equilibrium.

                        Shift the fourth limb upward while maintaining three of your limbs in contact with the walls.

                        Because you are practically standing on the faces of the walls, you will be moving straight up
                        the mountain mostly with your feet as your hands palm the surfaces of the walls to support your
                        weight and keep you balanced.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Stemming</h2>
                    <p>By applying pressure with your hands or feet to the opposing wall surfaces while climbing, you
                        can use the counterforce to maintain equilibrium. Put your left foot against one wall while your
                        right foot is against another.

                        This enables you to bridge the chimney gap while standing upright. You can get around
                        expressionless rock by using this method because it feels the most genuine. For climbing up
                        walls while riding on friction, you need to use your hands to palm surfaces or finger-lock
                        crevices.

                        The powerful muscles in your legs provide the force necessary for stemming. Palming is the term
                        for performing a similar action with your hands.</p>
                    <p>Stemming takes more than just muscle strength; it also calls for hip flexibility and balance. You
                        would do better in these scenarios if you did stretching exercises or even yoga because, in a
                        chimney, your foot usually balances you best when it is higher and farther away than is
                        comfortable. You must learn to trust your instincts, for which you need to be fit enough to
                        follow them, and you must train your hands to firmly grasp even the smallest flaws in the rock.

                        Strength is a metric of a smooth rock climber and refers to how much weight you can handle in
                        any given circumstance. Through rock climbing training, you can improve your power and endurance
                        by becoming more flexible and strong.</p>

                        <h3>Alpine</h3>

                        <p>In contrast to expedition style (or siege style) mountaineering, which entails setting up a
                            fixed line of stocked camps on the mountain that can be accessed at one's convenience,
                            alpine style involves mountaineering while being self-sufficient, carrying all of one's
                            food, shelter, and equipment as one climbs. A refusal of fixed ropes, mountain guides,
                            high-altitude porters, additional oxygen and doping drugs, as well as transportable
                            hyperbaric bags, is another requirement for alpine style climbing.</p>
                        <h3>Expedition</h3>
                        <p>As contrast to Alpine style, which includes carrying all of one's food, shelter, equipment,
                            etc. as one climbs, expedition style involves setting up a fixed line of provisioned camps
                            on the mountain that may be visited at one's leisure. Alpine style avoids fixed ropes,
                            porters, and camps, and climbers often only ascend the route once in a continuous push.
                            Expedition style also uses fixed ropes, and climbers (and the porters they regularly
                            utilize) will travel up and down the route numerous times to fix ropes and set up camps. Sir
                            Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay climbed Mount Everest for the first time using an
                            expedition-style technique.</p>

                            blankets. Climbers bring a sleeping bag. Like base camp, huts allow a trail to be divided
                            into several days worth of hikes and make it possible for climbers to travel with a reduced
                            pack. During warmer seasons, many huts have full-time staff or volunteers that manage the
                            daily activities necessary to keep the shelter running. In some locations, climbers have the
                            option to purchase snacks, meals, and drinks</p>

                            <h2>Tent</h2>
                            The basic structure of a tent is a pole framework that is covered in a tarp or other
                            material and secured with ropes and anchors. These shelters are easily portable and are set
                            up where they will be utilized. Simpler designs only need a thin tarp, but more robust
                            designs use bulkier materials that can withstand hazardous weather. In cases of severe
                            weather, tents might be erected under piles of snow or rock that serve as windbreaks and
                            fortify the shelter. The most popular kind of shelter is the tent.

                            <h2>Bivouac</h2>
                            <p>A bivouac, commonly referred to as a "bivvy," is a very basic kind of shelter. It does
                                not provide an entirely enclosed shelter, and in some circumstances, it may just entail
                                sleeping outside. Climbers use a sleeping bag and a bivouac sack when out in the open
                                (or bivvy bag). A bivouac sack is a thin, waterproof liner that adds another layer of
                                defense against bad weather and chilly conditions. A crevice in the neighboring rocks or
                                a ditch dug out of the snow, both of which provide extra shelter, are other options for
                                climbers to set up a bivouac. Climbers frequently pick this shelter because it enables
                                them to carry a less pack.</p>

                <p class="gd-hv">1-Slow down and be calm. Otherwise, a minor incident could turn into a large one.</p>
                <p class="gd-hv">2-Find out if the party can treat and evacuate them on their own or if more help is
                    needed.</p>
                <p class="gd-hv">3-If outside assistance is required, use your phone to request it. If there is no
                    signal, someone
                    must leave to call for assistance.</p>
                <p class="gd-hv">4-Never leave a victim unsupervised unless it is absolutely necessary, such as when
                    climbing in a
                    pair. Send at least two capable and dependable party members. To give the rescue services, note the
                    grid reference, a description of the scene, and the casualty's injuries. (A GPS receiver can be
                    quite helpful in giving rescue teams your precise location.)</p>
                <p class="gd-hv">5-Transport the victim to safety and keep them warm, hydrated, and at ease. However, if
                    you think a
                    victim may have suffered spinal damage, NEVER move them.</p>
                <p class="gd-hv">6-Stay close to your ascending route at all times because this is where mountain rescue
                    crews will
                    concentrate their search. Leave a sign directing the rescue crew in your way if you need to locate
                    shelter.</p>

                <p class="hz-text">
                    1-Mountain climbing has several risks that could prevent a climber from reaching the summit or even
                    endanger his life.
                </p>

                <p class="hz-text">
                    2-Avalanches, ice and snow slopes, crevasses, weather, climber falls, and altitude are a few of the
                    dangers.
                </p>

                <p class="hz-text">
                    3-Natural catastrophes, such as falling objects or weather events, are perhaps the most anticipated
                    or
                    frequent hazards. Many individuals do not anticipate that physical ailments will cause as many
                    fatalities. Many people can die from cardiac arrests and altitude sickness, especially on taller
                    mountains where there is less oxygen.

                    4-Rapid ascent up a mountain can lead to altitude sickness, and ultimately, death. Climbing ascents
                    up
                    mountains, such as Mt. Everest, taken three to four months because of the time needed to acclimatize
                    to
                    the lack of oxygen. Once climbers reach a certain elevation, there are strategic base camps set up
                    where
                    climbers will spend days, weeks, or even months getting used to (acclimatizing) to the lack of
                    oxygen.

            <h2>Success Story : Reinhold Messner </h2>
            <div class="split">

                <div>
                    The most accomplished climber of Mount Everest is Reinhold Messner, who was born in South Tyrol,
                    Italy, in 1944. He started mountaineering in the Italian Dolomites at age 5, hitting his first peak.
                    At the age of 20, Messner was among the top rock climbers in Europe. The massive Alps faces and then
                    the vast mountains of Asia caught his interest next.
                    <p><b>Climbing Everest Without Supplemental Oxygen</b></p>
                    <p>After climbing Nanga Parbat in 1970 with his brother Günther, who passed away on the descent,
                        Messner argued that Mount Everest should be ascended using "fair means" or without the use of
                        supplementary oxygen. According to Messner, using oxygen was dishonest. Since the air is so thin
                        and climbers would suffer brain damage, some physicians believed it was impossible for Messner
                        and climbing partner Peter Habeler to reach the summit of Everest without using oxygen bottles
                        on May 8, 1978.

                        "In this state of spiritual abstraction, I no longer belong to myself and to my eyesight,"
                        Messner said of his feelings while on the summit. I am merely a solitary, constricted lung
                        floating above the mists.</p>
                    <p><b>New Solo Route up Everest</b></p>
                    <p>Two years later on August 20, 1980, Messner again stood atop Mount Everest without oxygen after
                        climbing a new route up the North Face. For this audacious ascent, the first solo new route on
                        the mountain, Messner traversed across the North Face, and then climbed the Great Couloir
                        directly to the summit, avoiding the Second Step on the Northeast Ridge. He was the only climber
                        on the mountain and spent only three nights above his advanced base camp below the North Col.
